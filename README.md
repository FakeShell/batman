## batman

This program should work on all devices. needs wlr-randr and yad to be installed.

batman-gui is based on yad so requires yad to be installed. if the apt repo is used then there is no need to install any dependencies manually as it will install all the dependencies itself.

Tested with Phosh, sxmo and Plasma Mobile. It should work with any wlroots based desktop environment

It should be noted at this program has been tested on pmOS (a mainline OS), Droidian. (a Halium OS) and Manjaro Libhybris and AlpHybris.

upower should be in working condition and should return the correct battery and charging status. (which is the reason there is a special branch for Galaxy A5 because battery status reporting is broken, it has some missing drivers in kernel.)

It is currently available as a deb package, PKGBUILD and APKBUILD.

Not tested on Ubuntu Touch that has deep sleep and suspends things by itself.

# How to compile batman from source

## To compile batman-helper manually you can use gcc

```
gcc -DWITH_UPOWER -DWITH_WLRDISPLAY batman-helper.c wlrdisplay.c -o test -lwayland-client `pkg-config --cflags --libs upower-glib`
```

## If you don't want the upower support and want the script to use the old upower implementation use:

```
gcc -DWITH_WLRDISPLAY batman-helper.c wlrdisplay.c -o test -lwayland-client `pkg-config --cflags --libs upower-glib`
```

## If you don't want the wlr display status support and want the script to use the old wlr-randr implementation use:

```
gcc -DWITH_UPOWER batman-helper.c wlrdisplay.c -o batman-helper -lwayland-client `pkg-config --cflags --libs upower-glib`
```

> older wlr-randr and upower implementations are slower so it is recommended to compile batman-helper with upower and wlrdisplay support

The following packages have to be installed to compile with upower support

For Debian based systems:

`sudo apt install libupower-glib-dev pkg-config libwayland-dev`

For Fedora based systems:

`sudo dnf install upower-devel pkg-config wayland-devel`

For Arch based systems:

`sudo pacman -S upower pkgconf wayland`

For Alpine based systems:

`sudo apk add upower-dev pkgconfig wayland-dev`
